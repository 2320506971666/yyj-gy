# Your rule content
# 页面结构与框架
- Always use semantic HTML5 tags such as <main>, <header>, <footer>, <section>, and <article>.
- Use Next.js file-based routing conventions when creating new pages.
- Place all pages inside the `pages` directory, and components in `components`.
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling, avoid inline styles or external CSS files.

# 命名规范
- Use kebab-case for file names, PascalCase for React components, and camelCase for variables.
- Component names should reflect their purpose and location. For example: `HeroSection`, `Navbar`, `Footer`.

#  设计风格（以现代简约风为例）
- Use a minimalist and clean design style.
- Use responsive design principles with `flex`, `grid`, and Tailwind’s breakpoint classes.

# SEO & Meta
- For each page, always include <head> metadata: title, description, og:title, og:description, and favicon.
Ensure each page has a unique and descriptive <title>.

# 代码注释习惯
- For each component, add a short comment block at the top explaining its role in the site.
Use `// TODO:` comments for any unfinished or planned feature sections.

# 资源管理
- Store all static images inside the `public/images` folder.
- Use <Image> from `next/image` for image optimization.
- Keep assets (icons, logos, etc.) organized by type in separate folders.

# 可选：提升开发体验
Suggest reusable components when similar UI patterns appear multiple times.
Convert long CSS utility chains into reusable classNames or components.
